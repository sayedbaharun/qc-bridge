## 🔄 **DATA FLOW**

### **Task Creation Flow:**
```
1. User creates task in Notion Quick Capture
   ├── Title: Required
   ├── Area: Required (or sync skipped)
   ├── Project: Optional (auto-created if provided)
   ├── Milestone: Optional (auto-created if provided)
   ├── Priority: Optional (defaults to P2)
   ├── Status: Optional (defaults to To Do)
   ├── Focus Date/Slot: Optional
   └── Due Date: Optional

2. Bridge detects new task (60-second polling)
   ├── Validates area assignment
   ├── Calculates hash of properties
   ├── Checks for changes via hash comparison
   └── Processes if new or changed

3. RPC Function: create_task_from_capture_with_area()
   ├── Validates area exists
   ├── Finds/creates project in specified area
   ├── Finds/creates milestone if specified
   ├── Normalizes priority (P1/P2/P3 format)
   ├── Normalizes status (emoji format)
   ├── Creates task record
   └── Links to Notion via integrations_notion

4. Bridge updates Notion
   ├── Sets Supabase Task ID field
   ├── Checks "Linked ✅" checkbox
   ├── Updates sync cursor
   └── Logs completion
```

### **Change Detection:**
```
Hash Calculation (SHA-256) of:
├── Title
├── Area
├── Project
├── Milestone
├── Priority
├── Status
├── Focus Date
├── Focus Slot
├── Due Date
└── Assignee

If hash differs from stored hash → Process update
If hash matches → Skip (no changes)
```

### **Sync State Management:**
```
Before Sync:
├── Get last_synced_at cursor
├── Query Notion for pages newer than cursor
└── Process each changed page

After Sync:
├── Update last_synced_at to latest timestamp
├── Store cursor in sync_state table
└── Log sync statistics (created/skipped/errors)
```
