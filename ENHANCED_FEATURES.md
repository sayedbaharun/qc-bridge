# QC Bridge Enhanced Management Features

## Notion Alerts System

QC Bridge now sends alerts directly to a Notion database instead of Slack, keeping everything in your workflow.

### Setup

1. **Create System Alerts Database**: Run the setup script or create manually
```bash
npm run setup-notion
```

2. **Environment Variables**: Add to your `.env` file
```bash
NOTION_ALERTS_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id_here
NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID=parent_page_for_new_databases  # Only needed for setup
```

3. **Test**: Run a dry-run to verify alerts work
```bash
npm run dry-run
```

### Alert Database Properties

- **Title**: Alert message with emoji and level
- **Level**: WARN, ERROR, FATAL
- **Priority**: ðŸ”´ P1, ðŸŸ¡ P2, ðŸŸ¢ P3
- **Service**: Source service (qc-bridge)
- **Environment**: production, staging, development
- **Error Details**: Full context and stack traces
- **Correlation ID**: For tracing related events
- **Status**: Open, Investigating, Resolved
- **Created**: Timestamp
- **Resolved At**: When issue was fixed
- **Notes**: Investigation notes

## Enhanced Notion Databases

The system now includes several management databases:

### 1. Areas Management
- Central place to manage all areas
- Track project and task counts
- Configure default settings per area
- Monitor area activity

### 2. Project Templates
- Standardized templates for different project types
- Pre-defined milestones and success criteria
- Complexity and duration estimates
- Usage tracking

### 3. Executive Dashboard
- High-level KPIs and metrics
- System health overview
- Trend tracking
- Auto-updated metrics from QC Bridge

## Management API Endpoints

When running in server mode (`npm run server`), additional endpoints are available:

### Health & Monitoring
- `GET /health` - System health status
- `GET /metrics` - Performance metrics and statistics

### Sync Management
- `POST /api/sync` - Manually trigger a sync operation

### Areas Management
- `GET /api/areas` - List all areas with project/task counts
- `POST /api/areas` - Create new area
  ```json
  {
    "name": "learning",
    "description": "Professional development and skill building"
  }
  ```

### Projects Management
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
  ```json
  {
    "name": "React Dashboard",
    "area": "business", 
    "description": "Build monitoring dashboard for QC Bridge"
  }
  ```

## Usage Examples

### Create a New Area via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/areas \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "research", "description": "Research and analysis projects"}'
```

### Trigger Manual Sync
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sync
```

### Check System Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Frontend Dashboard Considerations

### Option A: Simple HTML Dashboard
- Use the existing health check server
- Add static HTML pages with JavaScript
- Real-time updates via fetch API
- Minimal setup, easy to deploy

### Option B: React/Next.js Dashboard
- Full-featured SPA with advanced visualizations
- Real-time subscriptions to Supabase
- Mobile-responsive design
- Requires separate hosting

### Option C: Notion-First Approach (Recommended)
- Enhanced Notion views and databases
- Custom formulas and rollups for KPIs
- Integration with existing workflow
- Zero additional hosting costs

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Use Notion for daily management**:
   - Task creation and tracking
   - Project planning
   - Area organization

2. **Monitor via QC Bridge APIs**:
   - System health checks
   - Performance monitoring
   - Alert management

3. **Automate with the enhanced bridge**:
   - Reliable sync operations
   - Automatic alerts in Notion
   - Performance tracking

4. **Scale with additional tools** as needed:
   - Custom dashboard for executives
   - Mobile apps for field work
   - Integration with other tools

This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: the flexibility of Notion for daily work and the power of a custom system for monitoring and automation.
